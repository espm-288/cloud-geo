# Welcome

This GitHub repository + notebook provides the real-time notes for our exploratory course on Cloud Native Geospatial Data in R & Python.  

The website is built using quarto to render qmd and ipynb files, and is rendered and published automatically through GitHub Actions.  

Users can use GitHub Codespaces to interactively run all files in the notebook for free and without installing any software.
